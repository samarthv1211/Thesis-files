\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
I would like to thank the following people for playing a significant role towards the completion of this thesis:

\textbf{My Committee:} My advisor Dr. Li helped me through each and every step of the thesis. He mentored me in developing the approach to solve the problem at hand. He made sure that my doubts would get solved at any time of the day. Thanks to his support, and the support of Dr. Kobza and Dr. Lee Martin, I was able to complete the thesis and my Master's degree. 

\textbf{My Parents:} I would again like to thank my parents because without them nothing would have been possible. 

\textbf{The University of Tennessee:} I am grateful to the UTK to take me in as one of their student and help me pursue my dreams.

\textbf{My friends:} I would like to acknowledge my friends for helping me get through the difficult times spent away from home. They made me feel like this was my home away from home.
