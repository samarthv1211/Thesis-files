@article{Brandon-JonesE.;SquireB.;Autry2014,
abstract = {Understanding supply chain resilience and robustness is increasingly important for supply chain managers. This is due to the growing complexity of contemporary supply chains and the subsequent increased probability of experiencing a disruption. Few studies within the risk management literature have empirically disentangled the concepts of resilience and robustness or explored their antecedents. This study utilizes a contingent resource-based view perspective to understand the relationship between specific resources (information sharing and connectivity), capabilities (vis-ibility), and performance in terms of supply chain resilience and robust-ness. In addition, it utilizes supply base complexity as a moderating factor. Survey data collected from 264 UK manufacturing plants suggest that supply chain connectivity and information sharing resources lead to a supply chain visibility capability which enhances resilience and robust-ness. Of the four dimensions of complexity, only scale is found to have a strong moderating effect on this relationship, while geographic dispersion , differentiation, and delivery complexity do not have contingent effects. This study highlights theoretical and managerial implications for approaches to resilience and robustness.},

@article{Falasca2008,
abstract = {Our research is aimed at developing a quantitative approach for assessing supply chain resilience to disasters, a topic that has been discussed primarily in a qualitative manner in the literature. For this purpose, we propose a simulation-based framework that incorporates concepts of resilience into the process of supply chain design. In this context, resilience is defined as the ability of a supply chain system to reduce the probabilities of disruptions, to reduce the consequences of those disruptions, and to reduce the time to recover normal performance. The decision framework incorporates three determinants of supply chain resilience (density, complexity, and node criticality) and discusses their relationship to the occurrence of disruptions, to the impacts of those disruptions on the performance of a supply chain system and to the time needed for recovery. Different preliminary strategies for evaluating supply chain resilience to disasters are identified, and directions for future research are discussed.},

@unpublished{Fujimoto2011,
abstract = {This paper argues that, even after the unprecedented earthquake in east Japan on 2011.3.11, the basic principle of designing industrial supply chains should achieve its competitiveness and robustness simultaneously, as opposed to psychological overreaction that emphasize the latter alone. After critically evaluating proposed changes on the damaged supply chains such as adding inventories, adopting standardized parts, duplicating equipment and tools, and evacuating facilities, the paper argues that, in the era of intensifying global competition, those proposals are appropriate only when it sustains supply chain competitiveness. As an alternative measure to make the chain more robust without significantly adding product cost, the paper proposes making the supply chain “virtual-dual” by enhancing portability of design information.},

@article{Kim2015,
abstract = {Increasingly, scholars recognize the importance of understanding supply network disruptions. However, the literature still lacks a clear conceptualization of a network-level understanding of supply disruptions. Not having a network level understanding of supply disruptions prevents firms from fully mitigating the negative effects of a supply disruption. Graph theory helps to conceptualize a supply network and differentiate between disruptions at the node/arc level vs. network level. The structure of a supply network consists of a collection of nodes (facilities) and the connecting arcs (transportation). From this perspective, small events that disrupt a node or arc in the network can have major consequences for the network. A failure in a node or arc can potentially stop the flow of material across network. This study conceptualizes supply network disruption and resilience by examining the structural relationships among entities in the network. We compare four fundamental supply network structures to help understand supply network disruption and resilience. The analysis shows that node/arc-level disruptions do not necessarily lead to network-level disruptions, and demonstrates the importance of differentiating a node/arc disruption vs. a network disruption. The results also indicate that network structure significantly determines the likelihood of disruption. In general, different structural relationships among network entities have different levels of resilience. More specifically, resilience improves when the structural relationships in a network follow the power-law. This paper not only offers a new perspective of supply network disruption, but also suggests a useful analytical approach to assessing supply network structures for resilience.},

@article{Kitano2004,
abstract = {Robustness is a ubiquitously observed property of biological systems. It is considered to be a fundamental feature of complex evolvable systems. It is attained by several underlying principles that are universal to both biological organisms and sophisticated engineering systems. Robustness facilitates evolvability and robust traits are often selected by evolution. Such a mutually beneficial process is made possible by specific architectural features observed in robust systems. But there are trade-offs between robustness, fragility, performance and resource demands, which explain system behaviour, including the patterns of failure. Insights into inherent properties of robust systems will provide us with a better understanding of complex diseases and a guiding principle for therapy design.},

@article{Scheibe2017,
abstract = {When a disruption occurs in a firm, its effects are often felt throughout the supply chain. As supply chains expand glob- ally and companies pursue velocity and efficiency, the probability of disruptions propagating throughout a chain grows. In this paper, we employ a qualitative, grounded theory case study approach to help understand what drives supply chain disruption propagation and to provide theoretical insights into this emerging area. For a more complete perspective, we study three interconnected tiers in seven unique supply chains. Each supply chain triad consists of (1) a focal firm (a manufacturer), (2) a supplier to the focal firm and (3) a customer of the focal firm allowing us to gain perspective from three levels in multiple supply chains. Three aggregate dimensions are defined which help explain the propagation of supply chain disruptions: the nature of the disruption, structure and dependence, and managerial decision-making. Within these dimensions, six themes are identified giving an increased level of granularity into disruption propagation: correlation of risk, compounding effects, cyclical linkages, counterparty risk, herding and misaligned incentives. Organi- sations should consider these themes and their interactions to effectively deal with supply chain disruptions.},
